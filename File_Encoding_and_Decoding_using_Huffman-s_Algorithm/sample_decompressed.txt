Huffman coding is a widely used compression algorithm that efficiently represents characters in a message by assigning variable-length codes based on their frequencies. The algorithm begins by constructing a frequency table for all possible ASCII characters in the given input. Then, it builds a binary tree, known as the Huffman tree, where characters with higher frequencies have shorter codes. The process involves iteratively combining the two least frequent characters until a complete binary tree is formed. The resulting variable-length codes are assigned to each character, ensuring that no code is a prefix of another. This unique prefix property allows for unambiguous decoding. The efficiency of Huffman coding lies in its ability to assign shorter codes to more frequent characters, reducing the overall size of the encoded message and facilitating faster data transmission and storage.
